### Drupal Menu Collapse

This module is designed to close the gigantic form that comes with the Menu Attributes module (https://www.drupal.org/project/menu_attributes).

Install and enable the module, and the menu attributes form fieldset will be closed by default on edit forms for menu items, as well as basic pages.
